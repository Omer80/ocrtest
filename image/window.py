def norm_shape(shape):

    Normalize numpy array shapes so they're always expressed as a tuple,

    Parameters
        shape - an int, or a tuple of ints

    Returns
        a shape tuple

def sliding_window(image, windowSize, shiftSize=None, flatten=True):

    Return a sliding window over a in any number of dimensions

    Parameters:
        image  - an n-dimensional numpy array
        ws - an int (a is 1D) or tuple (a is 2D or greater) representing the size
             of each dimension of the window

        flatten - if True, all slices are flattened, otherwise, there is an
                  extra dimension for each dimension of the input.
